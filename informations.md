## Comments

* When a given path in pairable, it means that they may exist another path (going through some of the pairs) which will be in a cooperative interference with the given path.
* The permanent for a path indicates the number of ways pairs (or loops) can be formed. Thus a large permanent may indicate that there is a large amount of cooperative paths.
